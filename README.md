Building
===
To compile (JDK 7):

    javac -d bin -sourcepath src src/dht/*.java
    javac -d bin -sourcepath src src/tests/*.java
    
To run the test application (tests/DistributedStorage):

    java tests.DistributedStorage [localname] | [localname, remotename, remotehost, remoteport]
    
- Using the single argument `[localname]` will create a small local network, which can be identified with the given name. 
- Using the arguments `[localname, remotename, remotehost, remoteport]` will create a local node with the name localname, and connect to a network specified by remotehost and remoteport. Remotename must be registered in the remote host's RMI registry.
    
A more detailed description of the program, its' interfaces and performance evaluation can be found in the javadoc or the written report.
